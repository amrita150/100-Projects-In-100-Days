- how to set units to make website responsive
- how to set custom properties in css

### Custom properties
Custom properties, also known as CSS variables, are a powerful feature in CSS that allow you to define values that can be reused throughout your stylesheets. They start with -- followed by a name, and their values can be set, overridden, and inherited just like regular CSS properties. They provide a way to store values that can be reused across different parts of your CSS code, making it easier to manage and update your styles.
